        <span class="about">
        <p>I am a rising senior at Middlebury College studying computer science, graduating in May 2022. I`m an interdisciplinary computer science major, which for me means that in addition to all the core computer sicence courses, I take courses in animation and try to combine the disciplines where I can. I also have a minor in architectural studies. </p>

        <p>I am looking for an opportunity that will combine my passions for creativity and coding. I would bring my experience from my studies at Middlebury as well as my recent full-time internships, including a software engineering internship at bp. </p>
            
        <p> Please check out my resume or projects page for a better idea of what my experience is! </p>
