        <span class="about">
        <p>I am currently a front-end Software Engineer at HubSpot, and a recent graduate of Middlebury College, class of 2022. I was an interdisciplinary computer science major, so in addition to all the core computer science courses, I took courses in animation and try to combine the disciplines where I can, such as with my honors thesis on computer graphics. I also minored in architectural studies--fun fact: I got to help design a house that is currently being built! </p>

        <p>I have passion for all things creativity and coding, and I so am always looking for ways to problem solve. </p>
            
        <p> Please check out my resume or projects page for a better idea of what my experience is, and feel free to contact me with any questions! </p>
